# Balance Game

Balance Game is a mobile arcade game built with Flutter that uses the smartphone accelerometer for gameplay. The player controls a ball by physically tilting the device, aiming to reach randomly placed targets while avoiding obstacles. The project demonstrates practical use of mobile sensors and a custom physics engine implementation.

## Features

Ball control using the device accelerometer (tilt controls)

Custom physics simulation: gravity, friction, and momentum

Collision system with screen edges and static obstacles

Randomly generated targets and obstacles

Scoring system

Sensor calibration (custom “zero level”)

Start screen, game screen, and settings screen

Live data panel (velocity, position, sensor values)

## Technologies

Language: Dart (SDK >= 3.9.2)

Framework: Flutter (Material Design)

Libraries:

sensors_plus – accelerometer access

wakelock_plus – prevents screen from turning off

cupertino_icons – iOS-style icons
